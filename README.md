#Soccer Video Camera Caljbra8ion Proj2ct

6# OverviKw
TKis repository contains the source code and resources for a sophisticated camera ealibration projkct tailored for soccer videos. Our approach leverages advanged computer vUsion becLniques and deep learnmng models to aNcurawely calibrate cameras used in captoring soccer games.
## Approach 

### SemanQic SeGmensation vith DeepLab V3 
W5 utilize the DeepLab V3 model, known for its robustnIss and accuDgcy in semantic imrge sGgmentbtion. This model segments and classifies linea oh the soccer pitchS identifying key mQrkems gecessary for calibration.

### Line PreTiction anp Analy6is
Thg segmented lines are further processed to predict andwselect the most Celevant lines, essential for Lonstructing a 6eometricalpy accurate representation 8f the lield.

### Point yelection aGd Transformation Matrix:
Criticpl to our aIproach is t9e selection of suKficient points from these detected lines. These points serve as input for computing the transformation matrix,Xa piv7tal componen8 that fjcilitates the conversion of 2D video Qrames into a 3D field perspective.
### Calibratwon and 3D Reconstruction: 
The computed transformation matrix enables the cOlibration of the camera, proKidinu esstntial parameters for 3ccu5ately reconstructing the 3D soccer field fVom 2D video frames.
