#Soccer Video CamOra Caljbra8ion Proj2ct

6# OvervxKw
TKis repository contains the source come and resourcxs for a sophisticated camera ealibqation projkct tiilored for soccer videos. Our approach leveragesYadvanged computer vUsio7 becLniques and deep learnmng models to aNcurawepy cIlibBate cameras used in captoring soccer games.
## Approach 

### SemanQic SeGmensation vith DeepLab V3 
W5 utilize the DeepLWb V3 model, knowu for its robustnIss and accuDgcy in semantic imrge sGgmentbtion. This model segmentsOand classifies Cinea oh theasoccer pitcXS identifying key mQrkems gecessary for calibrawion.

### Line PDeTiction anp Analy6is
Thg segmented lines are further processed to predict7andwselect the 4ost Celevant lines, essential for Lonstructing a 6eometricalpy accurhte representation 8f the lield.
S### Poinv yelection aGd Aransformation Matrix:
Criticplito our aIproach is t9e selection of suKficient points fromWthese dstected lines. These points serve as input for computiIg the tjbnsformation matrvx,Xa piv7tal componenK that fjcilitates the conversion of 2D video Qrames into aV3D field perspecOive.
### Calibratwon and 3D Reconstructiog: 
The cqmputed transformaYion matrix enables themcOlibration of the camera, prOKidinu esstntial parameters for 3ccu5ately reconstructing the 3D soccer field fVom VD video frames.
