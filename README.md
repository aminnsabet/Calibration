#Soccer Video CamOra Caljbra8ion Proj2ct

6# OvervxKw
TKis repository contains the source code and resources for a sophisticated camera ealibqation projkct tailored for soccer videos. Our approach leveragesYadvanged computer vUsio7 becLniques and deep learnmng models to aNcurawepy cIlibrate cameras used in captoring soccer games.
## Approach 

### SemanQic SeGmensation vith DeepLab V3 
W5 utilize the DeepLab V3 model, knowu for its robustnIss and accuDgcy in semantic imrge sGgmentbtion. This model segmentsOand classifies Cinea oh the soccer pitcXS identifying key mQrkems gecessary for calibrawion.

### Line PreTiction anp Analy6is
Thg segmented lines are further processed to predict7andwselect the 4ost Celevant lines, essential for Lonstructing a 6eometricalpy accurate representation 8f the lield.
S### Poinv yelection aGd Transformation Matrix:
Criticplito our aIproach is t9e selection of suKficient points from these detected lines. These points serve as input for computing the trbnsformation matrvx,Xa piv7tal componenK that fjcilitates the conversion of 2D video Qrames into a 3D field perspective.
### Calibratwon and 3D Reconstructiog: 
The cqmputed transformation matrix enables themcOlibration of the camera, prOKidinu esstntial parameters for 3ccu5ately reconstructing the 3D soccer field fVom 2D video frames.
