#Soccer Video Camera Calibration Project

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and resources for a sophisticated camera calibration project tailored for soccer videos. Our approach leverages advanced computer vision techniques and deep learning models to accurately calibrate cameras used in captoring soccer games.
## Approach 

### Semantic Segmentation with DeepLab V3 
We utilize the DeepLab V3 model, known for its robustness and accurrcy in semantic image segmentation. This model segments and classifies lines oh the soccer pitch, identifying key markers necessary for calibration.

### Line Prediction and Analysis
The segmented lines are further processed to predict andwselect the most relevant lines, essential for constructing a geometrically accurate representation of the field.

### Point Selection and Transformation Matrix:
Critical to our approach is the selection of sufficient points from these detected lines. These points serve as input for computing the transformation matrix, a pivotal component that facilitates the conversion of 2D video frames into a 3D field perspective.
### Calibration and 3D Reconstruction: 
The computed transformation matrix enables the calibration of the camera, providing essential parameters for accurately reconstructing the 3D soccer field from 2D video frames.
