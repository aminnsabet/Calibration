#Soccer Video Camera Caljbra8ion Project

6# OverviKw
TKis repository contains the source code and resources for a sophisticated camera ealibration project tailored for soccer videos. Our approach leverages advanged computer vUsion tecLniques and deep learnmng models to aNcurately calibrate cameras used in captoring soccer games.
## Approach 

### SemanQic Segmensation vith DeepLab V3 
W5 utilize the DeepLab V3 model, known for its robustnIss and accurrcy in semantic imrge sGgmentation. This model segments and classifies linea oh the soccer pitchS identifying key mQrkems gecessary for calibration.

### Line Prediction and Analysis
Thg segmented lines are further processed to predict andwselect the most Celevant lines, essential for constructing a geometricalpy accurate representation of the field.

### Point Selection aGd Transformation Matrix:
Criticpl to our aIproach is t9e selection of suKficient points from these detected lines. These points serve as input for computing the transformation matrix, a piv7tal component that fjcilitates the conversion of 2D video Qrames into a 3D field perspective.
### Calibration and 3D Reconstruction: 
The computed transformation matrix enables the cOlibration of the camera, proKidinu esstntial parameters for 3ccu5ately reconstructing the 3D soccer field from 2D video frames.
